# STATUS — current work, blockers and next action

Updated 2026-10-10. **The foundation is built (A-1, PR #1), its database schema exists (A-2, PR #7) and the connector login is built (A-3a, PR #8; A-3b, PR #9):** Node 24
package with a committed lockfile, a fake GitHub for tests, the check scripts, throwaway-Postgres database tests, CI with
one `ci` merge gate, `src/db.js` creating the 13 foundation tables and storing connector logins, and the OAuth endpoints and `/api/mcp` (zero tools). No tools exist yet; no deployment exists. No GitHub App, credential, Vercel project or Neon database exists for this server; nothing here touches Chris's real
repositories.

## Next

- **A-4 — GitHub client, vendored OpenAPI and GraphQL descriptions, operation finders, rate discipline:** card to be written at its
  start (`work-index.json`, `docs/designs/BATCH-A.md` §1 A7–A9, §4 A-4). Branch `ai/<tool>/a-4-github-client` from `main`.
  Then A-5 (setup page, Apps from manifests, credential store; needs IN-02…IN-05 to try for real).
- **Answered 2026-10-10 (Chris):** IN-00 — plan approved ("I approve the plans"); IN-01 — **no automated review** ("I don't want the automated review at this time"); the repository stays public as Chris created it; the implementer self-reviews every diff.
- **Queue:** A → B → C → D → E → G → V → F → H → O → P → W → U → R → X (`MASTER-ROADMAP.md`).

## Environment

- Repo: `Robinson-AI-Systems/github-mcp` (public), default branch `main`. Every change goes through an `ai/*` branch and
  a PR; the `ci` check is the merge gate.
- Runtime: Node 24.x (`package.json` engines, every CI job). GitHub REST API version to pin: `2026-03-10` (still the
  newest on 2026-10-10).
- Dev commands (all finish by themselves): `npm ci`, `npm run check`, `npm test` (unit), `npm run test:db` (throwaway
  Postgres: CI service, or local binaries — works as root), `npm run test:shapes` (Octokit against the fake GitHub).
- Vercel project, Neon database, GitHub Apps: not created yet (IN-02, IN-03, IN-04, IN-05).

## Recent changes (newest first)

**2026-10-10 — A-3b connector login endpoints (PR #9):** `api/oauth/{register,authorize,token}`, `api/well-known/*` (rewritten
from `/.well-known/*` by `vercel.json`), `api/mcp.js`, `api/index.js`. Contract-generic `src/core/{http,oauth-handlers,mcp-auth,
mcp-server}.js` take an injected policy; the GitHub rules are in `src/oauth/policy.js`: the authorize page lists the accounts
(checkboxes + default), mode, profile, listing and the passphrase; **production is refused unless the deployment is the production
one and every selected account has `production_enabled`**; settings are examined only after the passphrase is right; a missing
`ADMIN_PASSPHRASE` fails closed; the code → token grant copies every connection setting from the issuing row, refresh rotates on the
same row. `/api/mcp` authenticates the bearer and lists the registry's tools (none yet); every `tools/call` is refused by the default
dispatcher until Batch B supplies a guarded one. `src/runtime.js` creates the schema once per instance. Tests: handler round trips,
production refusals, lockout, escaping, MCP over a local HTTP server, and one full flow on throwaway Postgres.
Nothing was run against a deployed server (none exists; IN-02).

**2026-10-10 — A-3a connector login store (PR #8):** `src/core/oauth.js` (copied from `stripe-mcp` @ 90a49c0: token hashing,
PKCE S256, redirect validation, client address, 5-failures-in-15-minutes lockout) with one fix — an empty submitted
passphrase used to crash the login check instead of counting as wrong (port back to the source and the hub core).
`src/db.js` gained `checkConnection` (refuses a connection with no accounts, a default outside the list, or an unknown
mode, profile or listing) and the store: clients, single-use codes, access tokens, atomic refresh on the same row for the
same client, revocation, login-attempt counting, `listAccountsForLogin`. Codes, tokens and client secrets are hashed. Fake
database mirrors it; one shared contract (`test/contract/oauth-contract.js`) runs against the fake and real Postgres.
Tests: `tests/unit/oauth-core.test.js`, `tests/unit/oauth-store.test.js`, `tests/db/oauth.test.js`. No endpoints yet (A-3b).

**2026-10-10 — A-2 foundation schema (PR #7):** `src/db.js` — `SCHEMA_TABLES` (13 tables), `CONNECTION_FIELDS` and
`connectionSettings(row)`, `productionSql()` (lazy Neon client, plain error when `DATABASE_URL` is missing, nothing at
import time), `createDb(sql)` → `{ initSchema(), listTables() }`; `initSchema()` runs the §2 `CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS`
statements one per call, in order (idempotent, no drops, no data). Fake database gained `initSchema`/`listTables`.
Tests: `tests/unit/schema.test.js`, `tests/db/schema.test.js` (exact table set, idempotence, defaults, keys, no plaintext
secret column). The two expiry timestamps `user_token_expires_at` / `user_refresh_expires_at` are allow-listed in that
scan. No Neon database exists yet (IN-02); nothing was run against a real one.

**2026-10-10 — CI cadence (docs + CI config PR #5):** never push while a PR's CI run is in progress (SESSION-START §6,
PLAYBOOK Step 5); obsolete PR runs are cancelled, runs on `main` never are. Next action unchanged.

**2026-10-10 — A-1 foundation merged (PR #1):** `package.json` (Node 24.x, pinned dependencies, lockfile), ESLint,
three Vitest suites (unit, db, shapes), `scripts/check-secrets.mjs` (scans tracked files for GitHub tokens, PEM keys,
non-local database URLs, Neon/Vercel identifiers, committed `.env`), `check-docs-updated`, `check-writes` and
`check-budgets` (starting form), `check-core-imports`, `count-catalog.py` and the index validator in `npm run check`;
`scripts/local-postgres-test.sh`; `test/helpers/fake-github.js`; CI jobs check, unit, db, shapes and the aggregate `ci`.
A deliberately failing test turned `unit` and `ci` red once (https://github.com/Robinson-AI-Systems/github-mcp/actions/runs/38077330755), then was removed; the final run is green at the
exact head (linked in PR #1). Actions pinned to `actions/checkout@v7` and `actions/setup-node@v7` (Node 24 runtimes). Cards A-2 and A-3
written.


**2026-10-10 — Gap check against prior toolkits (local commit):** every GitHub tool name Chris built or planned in
`robinsons-toolkit-mcp`, `robinsonai-mcp-servers` and `robinsons-toolkit-api` (528 names) mapped to this plan in
`docs/audits/2026-10-10-prior-tools.md`: 432 covered by hand-built tools, 59 by the universal tools, 34 dropped with
evidence (GitHub retired the endpoint, Enterprise-only, or out of scope), and 4 gaps added — `github_content_check_codeowners`,
`github_release_delete_asset`, `github_package_delete`, `github_security_compare_dependencies`. Catalog now 305 tools
(299 hand-built + 6 universal). Cortiware, oldReplit and Household-Assistant were checked for GitHub needs too.

**2026-10-10 — Plan completed (local commits):** process and acceptance files (PLAN, MASTER-ROADMAP, STATUS,
AI-PR-READ-FIRST, ARCHITECTURE, GO-LIVE-CHECKLIST, DECISIONS, ROADMAP, OWNER-GUIDE), the Appliance Desk profile
(`APP-NEEDS-APPLIANCE-DESK.md`, rows G1–G20), drift protocol and archive index. The catalog counter moved to
`scripts/count-catalog.py`; profile tools renamed `github_profile_*` so they no longer share a prefix with GitHub
Projects tools; a dated amendment lets a profile allow its own agent steps on an owned branch (Appliance Desk's
`transfer/**`).

**2026-10-10 — Plan written (initial commits):** AGENTS, START-HERE, SESSION-START, PLAYBOOK, research audit (GitHub API,
credentials, old toolkit's 311 tools and 20 bugs, official connector comparison), 15 batch designs, TOOL-CATALOG (301 tools:
295 hand-built + 6 universal, every name `github_…`), owner inputs IN-00 … IN-14, work index (64 cards since the old-toolkit decision note was dropped) with validator,
first card A-1.

## Blocked

Nothing in engineering. IN-00 and IN-01 answered; owner inputs IN-02 … IN-13 (`OWNER-INPUTS.md`; IN-14 answered: not needed)
are open and none blocks A-4.

## Unverified (each has an owner card)

- Paid security feature prices per active committer (O-4 §0 row O4) — read GitHub's pricing page before O-4 and H-4 merge.
- Whether Appliance Desk's `main` ruleset also blocks force pushes and deletion (APP-NEEDS row G3) — P-2 reads it.
- That `2026-03-10` is still the newest REST version when A-4 starts (BATCH-A §0 row A2).
