## 2026-10-26 — C-6 faster guarded PR lane (#418, final review pending)

Owner-approved developer workflow throughput improvement: standard PR open with no labels directly delegates to the existing guarded writer rather than duplicating repo/PR inventory, exact-head merge prep reads independent repo/PR evidence concurrently, and stack preparation reads 3 PRs at a time while keeping ordered validation and a single guarded write. Synthetic scheduling improvements range 25–67%, **not** live traffic performance. Source head `7bb96acc` passed all required `ci` and `release-policy`, full unit, DB, RTC, browser, shapes and check; final docs head and merge still require exact-head checks. `docs/status/2026-10-26-c-6-fast-pr-lane.md` and card C-6 preserve test evidence and deferred live acceptance. No production release initiated.

## 2026-10-26 — PAR-3 binary-safe Git commits (#413)

The GitHub MCP adds a guarded `github_content_commit_git_data` command: write up to 12 binary/text files or deletions on a named branch through actual Git blobs, a tree and a single commit whose parent is the observed branch head; move the branch without force. Canonical base64 preserves PDF bytes; branch races cannot discard other commits. Production branches and protected `pr-only` repos retain the original safety gates. The source PR includes full dispatcher, binary, negative/race and write-contract tests. The reviewed code passed all required CI jobs on source head `434bed1c` and had its only inline review issue addressed and resolved. The exact final documentation head must likewise pass both required gates before merge. **No live deployment or real Muse binary upload acceptance is claimed.** CI-start gaps and application-specific historical scanners/browser shards are separate, recorded in `docs/pr-cards/PAR-3.md`.

## 2026-10-26 — MUSE-2 public Muse onboarding under implementation

See `docs/status/2026-10-26-muse-2.md`: public secretless OAuth client registration, Android Muse fallback Client ID, canonical-audience compatibility and per-person GitHub authorization are being implemented in a review branch. No user-facing Muse acceptance or production deployment is claimed by the branch.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 closed, CAP-5 planned, owner checklist extended

CAP-3 and CAP-4 marked MERGED in the index (#274, #277, #281). CAP-4 closeout with dispositions in its card; backlog in ROADMAP. CAP-5 card written (capability report + scratch-org acceptance through the saved connection). Owner checklist gains connection and enterprise rows. AGENTS.md now tells agents to run `BASE_SHA=... npm run check` as CI does. Docs only.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 review fixes (follow-up to merged #277)

Two review findings on #277 fixed with tests: App JWT webhook writes now record a provider secondary-limit cooldown on error (next mutation is blocked), and SCIM deprovision's `removed` result comes from the independent readback instead of being assumed. Remaining CAP-4 items stay on docs/pr-cards/CAP-4.md.
## 2026-10-22 — device checks separated

Real-device checks (PUB-4 phone/desktop) moved to docs/OWNER-CHECKLIST.md; they no longer block implementation or merges. Docs only.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 signed App owner installation governance source and tests assembled

Pre-source slice plan `94e080f977e36441212d80867a7bfc361c4a1486` preceded exact JWT-only permission / installation-request implementation. Candidate `cfd4ff097fdf4e9b03bfd6b74fb6d6b3e9f1faad` adds two App-owner tools with six source authorizations/cross-tenant boundaries: account-bound existing signer, fresh provider App owner ID check, exact active stored installation ID, stable account/app/target IDs, bounded grant/event/suspension projections, and only account-matching pending installation requests from the App-global feed. Seven synthetic unit tests and a real PostgreSQL sealed signer/tenant test are committed and require new exact-head CI before success may be claimed. GitHub compare vs main `473aa9b` counts 1012 production additions/two removals; original CAP-4 delivery is still CONTINUE. No real GitHub grants, provider writes, production tenant changes, public distribution or merge.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 CI repair and App-owner route reconciliation (draft #277)

Exact head `752c57f` was red on three test-only assertions (registry order, a leak-check pattern that also matched `"app_id":901`, and a missing `created_at_local` in a PostgreSQL expectation); fixed in `d1e4c66` with no application change, and that head is fully green. A follow-up commit maps seven exact App-owner JWT routes to their native tools in the capability inventory (`tests/unit/cap4-inventory-reconciliation.test.js`); the inventory reads 139 implemented-unverified, 1,176 unresolved, 234 missing. Source additions vs main are now 1,025 (2 removals). **Exact-head CI on the new commit must pass before any claim.** PR #277 stays DRAFT / DO NOT MERGE: enterprise principal and audit, registry streaming, credential administration, remaining App lifecycle and the other CAP-1 rows remain open, and real provider/device acceptance is still separate and open.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 App JWT installation grant and request authority (draft #277)

The pinned original CAP-4 App JWT administration family now adds two account-scoped read-only tools, with an independently committed pre-source slice plan. The enrolled App owner is provider-verified through current GET /app; installation grants use the exact persisted installation ID, App ID, numeric account ID, owner login and target type, then project bounded permission/event/status fields without tokens. Installation requests read one capped global provider page but disclose only requests matching the connected account’s stable numeric GitHub ID and login, never raw other-tenant requests. This is different from existing I/U installation inventory, and does not route generic /app calls. Source and synthetic/real-database verification are pending this feature’s exact CI. CAP-4 original whole unit remains CONTINUE, no live credentials/tenant or release changed.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 App JWT redelivery follow-through, pending exact CI

Restored a mid-chat prepared-but-not-pushed App webhook redelivery candidate and completed its real synthetic/DB acceptance tests before push. Current planned HEAD `8911f45e01b59f8135903c2507a579cfa340b4a3` adds `github_app_webhook_redeliver`: exact enrolled App owner/installation and delivery GUID checks, Full/production/confirm, HTTPS destination warning, JWT-only request, independently observed new same-GUID/same-installation redelivery after HTTP 202, bounded App-global result projection, real database replay and explicit unconfirmed result if GitHub only queues. Owner-verified JWT-only writes (this new retry and existing webhook configuration PATCH) now use shared PostgreSQL write-slot pacing and rate-state gates, not bare-transport bypass. The frozen original CAP-4 report is updated to 893 meaningful production additions/2 removals relative to current main with CONTINUE; no whole CAP-4 completion. Exact new-head CI/release policy and independent real-world owner/provider acceptance have **not** yet been observed. No production activation, live webhook redelivery, publication or merge.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 exact App webhook retry lifecycle (draft #277)

A bounded JWT-only `github_app_webhook_redeliver` tool is added to the same original incomplete CAP-4 outcome. It requires exact enrolled App owner and installation, Full/production/confirmation, previous receipt GET, HTTPS destination read, provider accepted 202 and *new distinct* matching retry in a subsequent bounded delivery list before declaring a confirmed result. Accepted-but-not-observed returns unconfirmed; the journal request key prevents double-retry. No raw webhook payloads/credentials or real provider operation. All new exact-head CI and reviewed origin/tenant behavior remain to be tested; comparator remains honest CONTINUE, so no merge.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 App JWT request-origin defect resolved in draft

CI `39829336914` identified a write-metadata mismatch (`JWT` was cataloged but default declaration remained `I`) and a blocking Octokit request construction bug: a top-level webhook `url` parameter changes Octokit's HTTP destination rather than the GitHub JSON body. The JWT-only App config write now declares `cred:'JWT'` and sends `data:{url,content_type}` to the FIXED `PATCH /app/hook/config`. Unit and disposable PostgreSQL regressions enforce the GitHub API request path and zero unmatched/external calls. The initial defective source was never merged/deployed. Revalidate new exact-head CI and retain original CAP-4 `CONTINUE` until full original scope is finished.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 planned-delivery comparison refreshed (source-only, CONTINUE)

The CAP-4 delivery report is updated against the current feature branch `5fab17373d9964ac529634fba74bc7a732710017` relative to main `473aa9b5883c51ea7026be639ab7ec7ba5a62682`: **779 meaningful production additions / 2 removals** (excluding tests/docs). Original three criterion strings remain unaltered, with truthful App JWT webhook read-and-config source evidence and explicit remaining engineering; **CONTINUE** is required. Previous exact head `a688530af3326439a9dfd0093520a36416f97c86` passed both required CI and policy, including real PostgreSQL sealed signer and identity checks (170/170); the subsequent write changes have no current exact-head CI at this moment. The branch ref is current but GitHub PR metadata briefly lagged the pushed ref, so both remote ref and PR head require reconciliation before any new-head check may be claimed. No merge/release/live provider operations authorized.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 guarded App JWT webhook change (draft #277)

Added `github_app_webhook_configuration_set` through existing Full + production + confirmed journaled write using the exact App owner's encrypted-key JWT. This implements a supported App webhook config PATCH (not an App-secret entry): strictly HTTPS host URL or content type only, independent hash-based preflight/readback, refuses insecure/foreign current App state and omits raw URL paths and provider signing secrets from history/replay/results. Strict end-user production and owner authorization are preserved; no real GitHub write performed. Original CAP-4 still incomplete, comparator remains CONTINUE and final source CI pending.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 frozen original delivery accounting (CONTINUE)

`docs/pr-cards/CAP-4.delivery.json` records the actual source comparison (679 production additions, two removals at candidate `d744edf`) and accounts for all three ORIGINAL frozen CAP-4 acceptance lines in order. It truthfully returns CONTINUE with explicit remaining enterprise/registry/App-JWT/permission/operation reconciliation and separate real provider/device acceptance; passing source CI is **not** full-unit completion. Comparator `npm run session:bundle -- --card docs/pr-cards/CAP-4.md --planned-at a33d9eeef17a20617f3f2bc1d733d3a008050f46 --report docs/pr-cards/CAP-4.delivery.json` is expected to return `CONTINUE_BUNDLE` (exit 2), not a pass, while original scope is incomplete. The new real-disposable-PostgreSQL sealed App JWT test must still pass exact-head CI before any claim. No production credential or release was changed.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 exact App JWT owner seam (draft #277)

The existing encrypted GitHub App JWT signer now supports an enrolled App owner only for read-only `GET /app`, App webhook configuration and bounded delivery metadata. The read handler checks the connection's selected account, denies RTC passes, joins exact stored App owner/type to account, and confirms fresh provider App ID and owner stable numeric ID before using JWT. No raw JWT, webhook secret, delivery request/response, global other-tenant installation data, or user-supplied App ID enters tool arguments/results; delivery pages only project the owner's active installation. This is **source only**, no owner credential enrollment, live provider write, production change, or whole CAP-4 completion. Exact-head source CI and independent provider acceptance are still required.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 SAML organization credential authority engineering (draft #277)

Added organization SAML SSO credential-authorization inventory and exact one-ID revocation as part of the same unfinished original CAP-4 unit, reusing enrolled organization I and the existing full-profile/production/confirmation/replay guard. Provider's official Administration read/write requirements stay exact; no enterprise principal, new PAT, foreign tenant scope, bulk unverified 202 handling, live provider deletion or release. Read and journal states omit credential suffix/fingerprint/secret metadata and refuse incomplete/foreign inventory; deletion requires independent absence readback. Synthetic fixed-shape tests and required exact-head checks must pass; no remaining original CAP-4 criteria are marked complete by these two tools.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 guarded SCIM provisioning/deprovisioning implementation, draft #277

Following main/live reconciliation and reviewed official GitHub SCIM 2026-03-10 contracts, the active CAP-4 draft adds organization-only SAML SCIM provision/invite, controlled display-name-only PATCH and deprovision. All three flow through existing journaled guarded writes: exact enrolled organization App I, full profile, production, required confirmation, preview before changes, provider GET/list preflight and independent readback, replay/unknown-failure handling. Provider member write permission, SAML/Enterprise Cloud prerequisites and real owner authorization remain external and are not fabricated. The create preview states GitHub may restore former privileges; destructive delete removes external identity and cannot be undone. No arbitrary full-replace PUT or active=false deactivation tool is exposed because those silently remove identity/membership; these routes remain separate unfinished CAP-4 rows. Existing original CAP-4 remains ONE incomplete unit with no whole-subsection credit. Exact-head CI, review, plan comparison and external acceptance still required. No production actions or live credentials were used.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 governed paging/identity filtering, latest continuation

New draft #277 source adds exact GitHub.com organization audit cursor extraction and fail-closed host/org checks, scalar bounded event projections, and documented SCIM equality identity filtering with bounded, consistent pages. This is still only the initial organization read feature family within frozen original CAP-4. Latest main/live `473aa9b5883c51ea7026be639ab7ec7ba5a62682` separately includes #278's production transaction-local tenant namespace repair. The owner deferred CAP-3 private-tenant user/provider acceptance; this remains OPEN. No full CAP-4/CAP-5 completion, real provider proof, production write/spend, tenant activation or distribution change claimed. CI on this continuation head is required and previous green head is insufficient.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-4 approved source continuation, private-device acceptance deferred

Owner explicitly requested deferring CAP-3 real-client/provider acceptance while proceeding with CAP-4/CAP-5 eligible source work. Frozen original CAP-4 one-unit plan is on feature branch `ai/chatgpt/cap-4-governance-identity-20261022`, planned at `a33d9eeef17a20617f3f2bc1d733d3a008050f46`; its complete enterprise/governance/registry/integration scope is **IN PROGRESS (zero whole CAP-4 acceptance credit)**. First guarded organization audit + SAML-SSO SCIM read seam uses existing I scoped actor (new token kinds and enterprise principal deliberately not inferred), projects only bounded fields, returns incomplete paginations, and preserves provider 403/404 rather than manufacturing unavailable-on-plan. Exact official 2026-03-10 API contracts and unresolved enterprise-audit credential contradiction are in `docs/pr-cards/CAP-4.md`. No live tenant, credential, provider write, spend, source merge, plugin publication or release. The current remote-only GitHub session cannot run the local `session:bundle` runner; strict plan comparison and exact-head CI are still required before any merge. CAP-5 external acceptance cannot complete until CAP-4 and PUB-4.
## 2026-10-22 — instructions simplified (owner request)

AGENTS.md (534 → ~200 lines) and the bundle section of SESSION-START replaced with a finish-line policy: development never waits for acceptance, finished pieces merge, new scope needs Chris, un-curated inventory rows are backlog, counts are diagnostics. All hard limits/owner decisions kept; old text archived under docs/archive/. No code or CI change. Open work unchanged: CAP-4 #277 (green draft, split into mergeable pieces next), PUB-4 #268 (needs real device acceptance), CAP-5 not started.

## 2026-10-22 — private bootstrap HTTP namespace recovery

Released main/live `abb5f177770de8bdedc31cbce0ef7181e85d55be` is READY. Actual custom MCP App I/U reads and the exact GitHub user-installation read succeeded; foreign-account and missing optional credential calls refused. The owner completed protected administrator authentication, but private bootstrap returned its safe generic initialization error. Read-only production diagnostics found one repeat-safe bootstrap row, status provisioning, an existing tenant namespace and zero tenant tables. No tenant was activated. This narrows failure to initialization, before App/account material is copied; the exact hidden exception was not logged and is not claimed known.

Recovery replaces production tenant HTTP startup search_path options with a transaction-local parameterized set_config immediately preceding EVERY query in the same Neon HTTP transaction. Both private runtime entry and bootstrap retain the exact current_schema/search_path assertion and no public fallback. Session-based injected PostgreSQL adapters keep their explicit URL contract. Pinned-driver request tests cover both calls and failure without retry; disposable PostgreSQL tests route the actual Neon HTTP request through real transactions, initialize two schemas, interleave queries, check session reset and refuse missing schemas. Official references: https://github.com/neondatabase/serverless/blob/main/CONFIG.md#transaction-function and https://neon.com/docs/connect/connection-errors (pooled startup parameters). This is a focused correction within original CAP-3, zero newly completed subsections. Full CI, review, release and protected bootstrap retry remain required. Real optional PAT and actual ChatGPT/mobile/desktop callback gates remain OPEN; CAP-4 is still dependent.

## 2026-10-22 — merged CAP-3 source; deployment and private setup follow-through

PR #274 merged as `ea734896e150b74cc6f8d8ddfb11fb47c4989d9e` after exact source head `87a448ab` passed required CI/release policy (164 real PostgreSQL tests) and had no unresolved review threads. Owner explicitly approved moving deployment-dependent acceptance after merge/release and authorized acting on their behalf plus an unscheduled release. This supersedes earlier draft-only timing notes, not the original six acceptance criteria. CAP-3 remains IN_PROGRESS; real optional grant and native mobile/desktop return are NOT passed. Main's own checks and independently verified READY deployment remain release prerequisites. The existing daily receipt must be preserved; do not describe an additional owner-authorized release as a missed scheduled event.

Setup review found two concrete integration obstacles to real private acceptance: the service App's OAuth client settings were expected twice (encrypted App store and hosting environment), and private consent used a callback URL not present in the original App manifest. The follow-through reuses only the configured numeric service App's encrypted OAuth settings internally when no explicit pair is configured (partial pairs refuse), including scoped user refresh. No member/owner bearer is copied or substituted. Private provider consent now returns to the already-registered `/api/github/user-callback` with an unambiguous `pt.` state marker; marked callbacks never enter owner state storage, even when malformed. The private CSRF cookie is scoped to that callback, retaining Lax top-level GitHub return semantics. No GitHub App permission/callback edit, secret export or rotation is required. Native consent and identity/installation proof are still mandatory.

New helper tests cover exact App/AAD binding, missing/foreign/tampered data and incomplete configuration. The disposable PostgreSQL native consent -> optional enrollment test now uses a truly encrypted stored App client instead of duplicate env credentials and checks the exact existing callback. Full source CI on this follow-through is required. Production metadata currently has no private pilot/routing/App variables. Only approved robinson-ai-scratch (App 5281951, installation 170482829, active/all repositories confirmed through the custom service) is the proposed isolated test target. No private tenant, optional token or new provider permission has been activated at this checkpoint.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-3 client acceptance recovery, current source checkpoint

Owner connected the standalone custom MCP in ChatGPT and authorized acting on their behalf plus an unscheduled manual release if needed. Independently verified Vercel READY deployment `dpl_8CcpF7tYfrqaTv3Qn6mD2DxQBBdi` serves main/live `8aa0931fa7fc75eeba3696ae665d068f9a7f7d55`, not draft #274. Exact prior source head `6e55c7cae2f35b51d28223fa9e8364df154167fb` has SUCCESS ci 39783679031 and Daily live policy 39784129520. New source changes need new exact-head proof.

Actual custom-service observations: `github_whoami` reports PREVIEW/read_only scoped to robinson-ai-scratch, I/U present and K/P absent. `github_repo_list` returned three real repositories, including private entries. Foreign-account listing was refused with outside_scope. Notifications without K were refused; no broader credential success was observed. These are legacy owner-connection observations, not private tenant K/P acceptance or independently observed desktop/mobile OAuth callbacks.

Review found a source compatibility gap, not merely missing device testing: the candidate sent a status-only response to a registered OAuth callback without a pending state/code/PKCE transaction. The repair routes a private notifications read's missing-grant response through MCP OAuth challenge metadata, retains the actual client transaction through native GitHub consent and the protected optional form, then issues the ordinary single-use PKCE-bound code with the original state and chosen account/mode/profile/listing. Standalone management ends on this service and does not forge an OAuth callback. Form responses use same-origin referrer policy to preserve Origin while callback/completion responses remain no-referrer. Additive nullable root-state columns preserve existing pending flows; runtime optional-token scope stays exact and private.

Local verification: repository check PASS, 85 affected unit tests PASS, 22 transport/challenge tests PASS (overlapping focused runs), request-shapes 21 PASS. The unsharded full unit run was interrupted after exceeding the feedback budget without a final result; required complete units/DB/RTC remain for exact-head CI, not counted as a local pass.

Source tests include nested github_call and github_batch challenge preservation, denied accounts/passes/unsupported routes, real MCP listing metadata, no code on failed verification/revocation, replay and preserved state/PKCE/settings. New disposable PostgreSQL integration runs native GitHub consent through optional enrollment into a tenant-bound one-use authorization code with wrong-verifier and cross-tenant denial. The prior source's green CI cannot certify these changes. Local browser acquisition failed (downloaded archive was invalid); no local/browser/device pass is claimed. Real optional PAT enrollment and private-client/native mobile/desktop return remain OPEN. No optional bearer was collected, no pilot was activated, no real write/spend/release was performed at this checkpoint.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-3 read-only runtime optional grant path (draft #274, verification pending)

The previous exact-head enrollment implementation passed all required CI and disposable PostgreSQL gates at `d83fb8239b6cb3237e36119a3c0a76c6412bc977`. A follow-up source change (not yet CI-verified at this head) connects only **current**, same-human, tenant-bound K/P optional ciphertext to the existing authenticated Octokit client. Each token acquisition rechecks current member/pilot, account and exact historical provider readback, plus AAD/fingerprint/expiry; every outgoing HTTP request for that private K/P token is checked again against an exact allowlist: K permits only `GET /user` (identity) and `GET /notifications`; P permits only `GET /orgs/{connected_org}/packages`. No write/GraphQL/thread/repo/foreign host or account read can use it, no owner/global token is borrowed, and private optional PATs are unavailable to service passes. Normal user U/App I, owner legacy K/P and all existing guardrails are unchanged. Added synthetic credential routing, wrong host/person/scope/expiry/denied write and Octokit transport tests. Real GitHub/client permission and callback acceptance remain separate and unperformed; retain DRAFT until new exact-head gates, review and original acceptance comparison finish.

## 2026-10-22 — CAP-3 one-use private browser enrollment integration (PR #274, pre-push candidate)

The in-progress CAP-3 draft now has an HTTPS-only private-member additional-credential form connected to the signed tenant client and its single registered return URI. The server creates a ten-minute hashed one-use setup state in the private registry, binds it to current membership/pilot revisions, original account/kind and prior credential fingerprint, consumes it before any provider call, and verifies the exact user numeric subject, OAuth scope header and harmless notifications/packages read before a newly tenant-AAD-sealed K/P token can replace its predecessor. Private diagnostic links only originate from the actual signed, tenant-scoped MCP client; they are never owner-global or pass links. Post-submit redirect carries a nonsecret enrollment/revocation status and original exact operation, with a fresh diagnostic required to recheck historical authority. Renewal uses fingerprint CAS even after local proof expiry; same-person revocation uses an independent GitHub identity read and CAS, and root emergency cleanup deletes pending states only for the affected account. Stale, interrupted, expired, revoked, concurrent and foreign-person cases are added to synthetic/browser and real disposable-PostgreSQL test candidates. No real provider token, GitHub account mutation, tenant pilot activation, production data, spend, manual deployment, or external client acceptance was performed.

**Verification is pending**, not a completion claim: source and tests are prepared for the existing draft branch, with no new exact-head CI/release-policy or independent browser/device/provider proof yet. Existing last green head `7c97017e64fb58dd9f4e0e4c582276e388596040` is only baseline. Before PR merge run all required suites and independent security self-review; original six CAP-3 criteria and CAP-5 live acceptance must not be silently marked passed. Remaining operator/provider approval and real client auto-recheck support must be recorded separately from source behavior.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-3 bounded private optional enrollment helper, still not user-facing

Draft PR #274 now includes `src/tenancy/optional-credentials.js`, an **internal-only** source path that verifies an active private member and current account, checks the submitted bearer against GitHub's stable numeric `GET /user` identity, observes the exact harmless K notifications or P organization packages read, checks the provider-issued OAuth scope header, seals the token with tenant+identity+account+kind+host authenticated encryption context, and invokes the existing atomic epoch/CAS private optional storage. It returns only a nonsecret one-time proof observation, uses a 24-hour local proof expiry and refuses stale actor/membership, account mismatch, unsupported kind, incomplete scope, provider error and conflicting replacement. Synthetic regression `tests/unit/cap3-optional-enrollment.test.js` covers K/P successes, tenant-AAD separation, missing scope, wrong subject/account, stale and concurrent membership, provider refusal, and CAS denial. **Not yet claimed passed on final exact-head CI.** The private tenant `operationAuthority` diagnostic also now checks this optional K/P record for the exact selected operation and tenant-derived user/account resource, returning only historical metadata without token decryption or dispatch; synthetic before/after and altered-proof cases were added. This is NOT an exposed enrollment API, user-authenticated protected page, registered-client upgrade/return callback, live provider test or functioning optional-token dispatcher. No actual optional credential has been enrolled. All six frozen CAP-3 whole acceptance lines remain IN_PROGRESS; CAP-4 stays dependent; the draft must not merge. The prior pre-edit draft head `1cc87ce6beedf3ea13a4f168b3d8de92cb369026` had complete SUCCESS CI 39714398353 (including DB) and daily live policy 39714823609; the new source requires its own exact-head checks. No real provider grant, tenant activation, production deployment or spending was performed.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-3 private root cleanup regression refinement, draft #274

Previous head `3a1c42e989632d10efc62e4f6b762391925885f2` passed exact-head `ci` workflow 39713584873 (disposable PostgreSQL, repository check, shapes, RTC, both unit shards) and required release-policy workflow 39713584875. The sole preceding DB regression arose from the incident cleanup response now including `optionalGrants`, and the test was corrected without changing cleanup guards. A subsequent new disposable PostgreSQL test fixture explicitly populates K optional-grant rows in **two** independent private tenants before an owner emergency revoke; it checks the affected tenant's optional grant deletion count and verifies the other tenant's row remains. This subsequent fixture needs its own exact-head CI before it counts as passing proof. The original six CAP-3 acceptance lines stay IN_PROGRESS: private optional enrollment callback/return, real encrypted-endpoint verification, full per-kind lifecycle and independent client/provider acceptance remain unfinished. No real credentials, production data, external provider grant, spend or release changed.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-3 isolated private member K/P store (source candidate, not enrolled)

The unfinished draft #274 now additionally has an **additive private-registry** PostgreSQL table `gh_tenant_optional_credentials` for *encrypted* classic notifications (K) and package (P) credentials scoped to the exact verified GitHub numeric human, tenant workspace, bootstrap account, kind, operation/resource, membership/allowlist epochs and expiry. An internal atomic insert/replacement requires active tenant/membership/pilot and a matching numeric GitHub subject, and uses ciphertext fingerprint compare-and-swap; a concurrent or stale replay cannot replace a newer grant. Internal retrieval refuses foreign workspace, changed/disabled membership and revoked/expired rows; revocation and emergency private-pilot root cleanup handle only the appropriate tenant-owned rows. Disposable local PostgreSQL tests exercise active bootstrap requirement, same human in separate workspaces, actor/account mismatch, K/P isolation, malformed scopes, stale epochs, compare-and-swap replacement, per-kind revocation and inability to revive a grant by reallowlisting. This is **only trusted internal storage**: no public/browser/chat enrollment route or scoped provider client wiring exposes these secrets, and no provider-readback or actual user permission has been claimed for an enrolled tenant token. Independent protected owner K/P readback and guided notifications setup remain distinct existing source features. CAP-3 frozen original six criteria remain unfinished, draft unmerged, latest exact-head CI/release-policy required. Source diff: 688 additions and 30 removals, excluding tests/docs/fakes. No real account, token, production data, paid action or deployment was touched.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-3 exact prior-read capability recheck, final source candidate

The `github_check_permissions` optional GitHub.com notification flow now distinguishes before/after **on the same enrolled account and exact pinned operation**: initially it returns the server-owned protected credential setup handoff, and after the same encrypted K credential has an independently observed `GET /notifications` readback, it reports `read-observed-at-enrollment` instead of asking to enroll again. Stored fingerprint, numeric GitHub principal, scope, account ID and permitted exact REST route are checked; no provider call is made by the diagnostic. A previous read is NOT evidence of present permissions, a writable operation or a right to retry an ambiguous write. Private tenants and scoped passes cannot get owner setup links or owner credential proof. Synthetic before/after direct MCP and `github_call` regression added. CAP-3 still lacks complete agent-client automatic return and additional-kind tenant lifecycle, so draft #274 stays unmerged. Current branch change from main is 564 production additions, 26 removals, but zero whole original CAP-3 subsection acceptance credit. Required exact-head CI and release-policy tests are pending at the new revision. No live user/provider, deployment, production settings or paid effects changed.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-3 guided optional authority setup from scoped MCP diagnostic (PARTIAL)

The scoped read-only `github_check_permissions` diagnostic on draft PR #274 can now recommend a server-owned, canonical HTTPS **protected** setup page for a selected connected owner's exact reviewed `GET /notifications` operation, where the required classic K credential is truly extra authority. `GET /orgs/{org}/packages` instead reports documented ordinary App support and does not manufacture a God-Mode-only setup requirement. The link takes the user to the existing administrator-passphrase, CSRF and Origin guarded manual entry page; no bearer, PAT, login secret, redirect code, untrusted domain or owner-page link is exposed to a private tenant or scoped service pass. The user must still complete the applicable GitHub-issued token and protected form themselves and recheck via MCP; no automatic provider PAT issuance, client callback, extra tenant enrollment or effective execution is claimed. Source tests cover direct and nested `github_call` diagnostics and wrong/missing provider origin, account, credential and context. This work adds to the verified protected owner optional F/P/K credential identity records and exact K/P **past metadata readback** already implemented in draft #274; all six frozen CAP-3 criteria remain only partially completed. Exact-head CI and release-policy gates are required on this revised source before any claim; publication, provider/user enrollment, spending and production settings remain unchanged.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-3 operation-source/identity readback continuation, still DRAFT

On existing draft #274, 2026-03-10 GitHub REST documentation is now reviewed for exact `GET /notifications` (classic PAT only, notifications/repo scopes) and `GET /orgs/{org}/packages` (ordinary App user/installation supported, so no extra token must be invented for Standard). The existing protected owner P/K enrollment also performs a bounded, explicit GET with the submitted token after identity verification: `GET /orgs/{org}/packages` (organization P token with `read:packages`) or `GET /notifications` (K token with `notifications` scope). A successful 200/array yields a ciphertext-CAS-bound proof only for that exact read and current account/actor; provider refusal, token replacement or missing numeric identity gives no operation proof. Fine-grained F remains identity-only without a selected permitted resource. No provider response or raw credential is retained. A protected P/K/F removal invalidates only its own encrypted secret/evidence. The owner diagnostic never gives optional owner proof to private tenant clients or delegated RTC passes and labels any successful readback **observed at enrollment**, not effective authority today. Synthetic endpoint and guarded form tests, real disposable PostgreSQL migration/current-ciphertext/invalid proof tests have been added. All six original CAP-3 criteria still have unfinished engineering, notably agent-initiated additional-kind return flow, per-tenant extra kind storage and lifecycle, complete resource verification, and deployed real client/provider acceptance. This branch remains unmerged; exact-head CI on the assembled revision is pending. Current original-PR production diff: 505 additions, 25 removals; original one CAP-3 subsection completion remains ZERO. No production, real provider/customer, extra account access, paid action or release was performed; source fixtures only.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-3 secure additional-kind owner metadata resumed (source, not complete)

The previous execution blocker is no longer blocking an additive metadata migration on draft PR #274. Owner-protected setup now binds an independently provider-verified numeric actor to the current encrypted P package token; fine-grained F and notifications K get only **identity-only** metadata when their actor can actually be verified. The existing token vault and owner scope remain unchanged; no second bearer store, secret-valued tool argument or tenant credential copying was added. New `gh_accounts.additional_credential_proofs` is an additive/re-runnable JSONB metadata-only column. Current token replacement and protected K/F/P deletion clear the exact recorded proof, and a CAS on the ciphertext plus SHA-256 check blocks stale/foreign binding. Real disposable PostgreSQL migrations/replacement/revocation tests and synthetic protected-credential tests were added. The scoped permission diagnostic reports `verified-at-enrollment` distinctly from `operationPermission:not-proven`. No provider readback of package/notification endpoint rights is claimed. The existing private tenant U binding still isolates two workspaces and rejects unverified resources. **All six original CAP-3 criteria remain partially open**, notably agent-initiated extra-kind enrollment, automatically returned protected handoff, exact supported operation/resource readback, full multi-tenant extra-kind lifecycle, concurrency and independent real client/provider acceptance. The latest source head is pending exact-head CI; failed suites, if any, must be corrected without skipping. Current source-diff measurement: 425 production additions and 25 removals, one incomplete subsection (zero whole-unit completion credit). PUB-4 #268 remains a distinct draft; the owner-controlled security pass correction #275 is already merged into main. No real provider mutation, production data change, new external user, spending or manual deployment.

## 2026-10-21 — private-user restricted-pass credential correction

Security correction found while recovering draft CAP-3 #274: private-member I calls use that member's App user bearer, which GitHub cannot mint down to a repository/permission-scoped pass. The credential adapter previously ignored that scope. It now refuses repository names, repository IDs and permission restrictions before directory lookup, decryption or refresh; owner U has the same refusal, while owner I retains the existing installation downscoping path. Ordinary own-user grants remain usable. Focused regression and RTC-pass tests: 37 passed. Full exact-head CI/release policy and self-review remain merge gates. This is a small independent security fix under AGENTS' security-hole rule, not a completed CAP subsection or bundle. CAP-3 #274 and PUB-4 #268 remain separate drafts. Independently verified production alias is READY at `315a3259faafa474a9b36cc8410c5718d5b9326f`; source-only fix needs scheduled deployment and genuine service acceptance. No real provider credential, mutation, release or spend.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-3 private-user binding recovery (still incomplete)

Recovery reuses existing encrypted private-user grants instead of introducing another bearer store. An additive nullable `authority_binding` column binds the current ciphertext fingerprint to verified GitHub.com numeric subject, tenant/identity, membership and pilot revisions, account/App/installation, expiry, and the exact harmless `GET /user` identity read. Native consent supplies this proof only after existing identity/installation verification and returns through the original scoped client's PKCE flow. Refresh replaces ciphertext and proof together using the existing lease/CAS; ordinary replacement clears old proof unless independently verified. Legacy credentials remain intact and unverified. `github_check_permissions` can now report the binding for that identity read separately from documented compatibility and actual guarded execution; no repository/write capability is inferred. A discovered unsupported private-user pass-downscope defect is isolated into a separate security PR under AGENTS' main-security-hole rule; ordinary user grants and owner installation downscoping stay intact.

Recovery revision `151afcc07ef68ce30052205ba70928531d4f271e` passed required CI `39673987346` (check, both unit shards, real PostgreSQL, shapes, RTC, aggregate) and release policy `39673985993`/`39673987466`. Real DB: 155 tests/23 files, including the four new binding cases and fourteen existing native consent/refresh cases. Local proof: 48 focused tests, 8,336 full units on the pre-final-migration tree, 21 shapes and 52 RTC tests. New real PostgreSQL cases cover additive/legacy migration, same human in two workspaces, identity-read-only proof gain, wrong scope/host, replacement versus delayed refresh, revocation/reallowlist epochs and stale consent. Any later integration head requires its own exact-head gates. Local PostgreSQL is absent; no local DB pass is claimed. Production independently verified READY via Vercel `dpl_EfnLBCBpcQRBWiabD1wHvfLsToi9`, canonical alias and exact live source `315a3259faafa474a9b36cc8410c5718d5b9326f`; CAP-3 is absent from deployment. Shared native acceptance checkpoint remains subject to documented single-runner ownership. No new live provider/tenant permission, spend or release.

**CAP-3 remains draft and all six original criteria remain open as whole criteria.** This source handles the existing private App-user grant foundation only. Additional typed optional credentials (fine-grained/classic/OAuth-App and verified service-App authority where actually documented), their protected/native enrollment and operation/resource readback, scoped agent-initiated upgrade/automatic return, full lifecycle integration and complete two-tenant synthetic-provider proofs remain engineering, not an external blocker. The historical safety rejection is not repeated for this narrower metadata change, and is not proof that the unfinished general credential work is impossible. Preserve the frozen plan `4975bf79b7fdf7c7c8ee30415e64098bcdb18055`, compare delivery against its original criteria, and do not mark CAP-3 complete or start dependent CAP-4 as if it were. See the existing CAP-3 card for precise next seams.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-3 typed credential eligibility in draft PR #274 (earlier incomplete candidate)

CAP-2 merged as PR #273 at `4a09af622f46c1d99a6544769fe23321945a31b7`. CAP-3 has a frozen pre-code plan at `4975bf79b7fdf7c7c8ee30415e64098bcdb18055`; its draft PR #274 adds only a read-only operation-specific credential eligibility resolver and synthetic tests. It does not handle token values, persist new grants, change GitHub permissions, authorize customers or prove provider execution. The planned storage/lifecycle change was not published because execution safety checks prevented the mutation; all six original CAP-3 acceptance criteria remain open. Real scoped grant persistence, consent/readback, replacement, concurrency and revocation remain future engineering. PUB-4 #268 and production deployment are unchanged. No live provider/tenant/customer change, paid action, manual release or public activation was performed. Exact-head CI must be reverified after this documentation change.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-2 frozen-plan source delivery for PR #273, final CI and merge conditional

CAP-2 original plan `1a5bd2e117a6bc3a265fc850b9eb555436fed2a5` is reconciled in `docs/pr-cards/CAP-2.delivery.json`: ordinary Full is explicitly present in both legacy owner and signed private pilot OAuth forms, Everyday stays default, real disposable PostgreSQL proves Full reconsent without changing older grants and guarded Full-only native/meta calls; real scoped RTC HTTPS fixtures verify Full-only execution, Everyday/read-only denial, area restrictions and replay. Source-only per-tool/operation capability evidence distinguishes documented compatibility, missing installation grants, user credentials, production mode, repository selection and selected user policy. Ordered remedy identifies independent GitHub owner installation approval versus separate user consent, never passes secrets or silently grants authority. Existing private pilot DB tests retain independently signed cross-tenant/identity protections. All actual provider operations, public device connection, changed GitHub App permissions and live accepted source remain **unverified**. Production source diff from main is 177 additions/5 deletions, a below-guide single-subsection exception requiring explicit substantial complexity review (full source integration and independent real-Postgres/HTTP security cases, no filler). Previous head `6f4792a7` passed full unit/RTC/shapes/check but current head `00c95e0` first DB run found one **test expectation path error**, not a failed write: write layer returns `result.default_account`; corrected in the final delivery commit. **Final exact-head CI, release policy, frozen comparison, reviews and expected-head merge remain mandatory.** PUB-4 #268 stays separate; CAP-3 new typed credential lifecycle is next, with separate security/state boundary. Last independently observed deployed `live=315a3259faafa474a9b36cc8410c5718d5b9326f`; no manual release, provider mutation, production enablement, paid action, new token or cross-project changes.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-2 explicit Full reauthorization regression on disposable PostgreSQL (PR #273)

The owner OAuth database lifecycle now has a same-client Everyday-versus-explicit-Full reconsent regression with independent refresh rotation and preserved production-off state; no account grant is automatically widened. This is new test evidence **pending exact-head CI** and does not close CAP-2's full standalone client/tenant/provider acceptance. New CAP-1-backed operation documentation diagnostics remain separate from effective GitHub grants. PUB-4 #268 is untouched, no actual user/provider credentials used.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-2 operation credential evidence (source candidate, unmerged)

Draft PR #273 now integrates CAP-1's exact four officially sourced REST credential rows into the scoped access diagnostic, returning documented versus unknown/unsupported I/U/App-JWT requirements without claiming installed grants, actual tool dispatch, real account permission or live readback. The operation must exist in the pinned schema and be requested for one already selected account plus area/tool. User K/P secrets remain confined to their own purposes. This extends existing ordinary Full explanation, preserves the pre-code original five CAP-2 criteria as OPEN, and touches no provider connection, tenant auth, grants, production, spend, migration or release. Required tests and exact-head CI on this extension are not yet observed. Concurrent PUB-4 #268 remains separate.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-2 Standard Full effective-access work IN PROGRESS (new branch)

Following CAP-1 merged #272, the source in `ai/chatgpt/cap-2-standard-full-effective-access-20261021` with frozen pre-code plan `1a5bd2e` improves the ordinary Full consent explanation and extends the existing App grant checker to diagnose a named tool's profile, connection mode, credential presence, unverified repository selection and existing policies independently. No source CI or deployed permission/provider acceptance is claimed yet. Full original CAP-2 still needs separate all-door integration, explicit upgrade/reauthorization recovery, real isolated tenant tests, exact-head CI/review and bundle comparison. Concurrent PUB-4 draft #268 untouched. No token, user permission, protected resource, production mode, spend, customer data, other project, release or external authorization changed.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-1 source delivery reconciled for PR #272 (as-if-merged handoff)

Frozen original four CAP-1 criteria now have machine-checkable `docs/pr-cards/CAP-1.delivery.json` evidence: 1,549 pinned operation records (1,232 REST, 309 GraphQL fields, eight independent workflows), explicit per-host and eight-per-row credential decisions, 15 official operation-specific token findings, unknown and disputed credential truth, guarded universal/curated route dispositions, and a no-fabricated-coverage report. Exactly one whole original CAP-1 subsection (522 source additions/zero removals) is accounted with a documented substantial single-unit exception. Source head `3f4142f` passed all exact-head Actions CI/release-policy checks, including real disposable DB, two unit shards, shapes, RTC and check. **The final delivery-documentation head must independently pass its full exact-head gates and frozen bundle comparator before #272 may merge.** Product authority, actual current user grants and live/provider verification are NOT delivered by CAP-1; unresolved operations are explicitly owned by CAP-2 through CAP-4. Next approved engineering after merge: CAP-2 Standard Full and CAP-3 secure additional credential setup, preserving PUB-4 #268 as a separate unfinished mobile/desktop entry. Production READY at last verified source `315a3259`, six commits behind main. No manual release, spend, provider mutation or tenant pilot activation.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-1 operation-specific credential evidence, new exact-head gates required

Continuing CAP-1 draft #272 (same original plan and one original unit), four source-pinned REST operations now have reviewed, operation-specific token/permission evidence instead of family guesses; other 1,545+ operations' unknowns stay explicit. New unit cases assert that documentation decisions cannot be altered or converted into effective connection grants. Previous head `e0fad565` had both required exact-head checks SUCCESS, but this new source revision requires its own full CI/release-policy and frozen-plan bundle comparison before CAP-1 can be called source complete. Current `main=5398c4f`, `live=315a3259` production READY at last independently observed Vercel deployment. PUB-4 #268 remains a separate unmerged draft with real device evidence pending. No provider, account, token, production, budget, deployment or public distribution mutation.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-1 draft conflict-inventory correction (PR #272; unmerged)

The existing frozen CAP-1 inventory branch remains one full original subsection, NOT a completed release or provider acceptance. Actual previous head `02d5e23b` had passing Actions `ci` (all unit/DB/shapes/RTC/check jobs) and `release-policy`; the next edit adds official-source conflict evidence for enterprise audit and GitHub Packages, explicit no-false-grant validation, family gap states, and regression cases. **New head checks and bundle delivery comparison are required**. PUB-4 draft #268 and real mobile/desktop sign-in remain separately open; no account authority, hosting, budget, token, production or live operation was changed.

## 2026-10-21 — CAP-1 source-pinned operation inventory implementation in progress

Owner-approved maximum-authority CAP-1 now has a pre-code frozen plan (`docs/pr-cards/CAP-1.md`, commit `0648d8ca10084d2e98cc736a8be5463acda66e60`) and a separate branch `ai/chatgpt/cap-1-verified-operations-20261021` based on main `5398c4f53ab4bd64a23876fb0135c0f8d4be3175`. The branch enumerates every source-pinned REST method/path, GraphQL root field and separately referenced Git/SSH, registry and MCP protocol workflow; it retains per-credential unknowns and distinct GitHub.com/GHE.com/GHES applicability rather than claiming that universal API discovery equals provider execution. Curated tool mappings are **implemented-unverified**, not live-verified. The static report and validator reject missing/duplicate/orphan operations, invalid credential evidence and summary drift. The validator is included in `npm run check`; new focused regression tests cover coverage truthfulness. Official source pinned revisions are in both vendor SOURCE files and the card.

**Verification and release boundary:** The new tests, `npm run check`, full unit/disposable-PostgreSQL/shapes/RTC suites and exact-head PR `ci`/`release-policy` have **not yet been observed** on this branch. Do not mark CAP-1 MERGED or PASSED before those run and independent review. This work makes no GitHub provider API calls, never reads credentials or changes owner settings, and completes no real direct-client/provider acceptance. PUB-4 draft #268 remains under separate development and must not be overwritten; PUB-5 is blocked. The original 57-row live acceptance queue is unchanged. Next: run exact-head CI on the substantial CAP-1 branch, repair all failures together, review output against the frozen criteria, complete normal merge gates, then move to dependent CAP-2/CAP-3 and independently required PUB-4 acceptance.

## 2026-10-21 — Sol 5.6 remaining identity/permissions implementation contract

Owner requested repo-specific preparation for the next implementer. See [concrete handoff](UNIVERSAL-IDENTITY-HANDOFF.md) for actual source/test paths, mapped original units, migration and ownership invariants, two-user/role fixtures, required checks and separate external prerequisites. The merged fixes listed there are source evidence; full tenant/role/capability work remains OPEN. This docs-only update changes no runtime, provider grant, deployment or acceptance result. Follow current original cards/queue and do not restart completed work.

## 2026-10-21 — native authorization header and tenant-routing correction

Source audit found strict Bearer scheme spelling in both the legacy MCP authenticator and
signed private tenant routing. Accept legal case/whitespace without modifying credential bytes,
HMAC tenant purpose/revisions, membership, database namespace or provider account. Invalid
signed tenant credentials remain refused before owner fallback. See [A-3/PUB-2 card](pr-cards/A-3-PUB-2-BEARER-IDENTITY.md).
Prior focused identity audit: 62 tests passed in seven files; new native/signed routing tests and
real PostgreSQL tenant-scope variants cover this correction. Exact-head full gates/merge required.
No source-complete CAP claim, pilot activation, release, new provider/live/device acceptance or
change to concurrent PUB-4 #268. Three explicit organizational roles are recorded in END-USER-AUTHORITY.

## 2026-10-21 — maximum-authority planning expansion (source planning only)

Reconciled actual `main=live=315a3259faafa474a9b36cc8410c5718d5b9326f` (Git refs; deployed READY/runtime not reverified). PUB-3 #267 is merged; concurrent PUB-4 #268 remains a draft and is untouched. Older entries below describing #267 awaiting merge are historical. Existing original acceptance ledger is unchanged; no new live evidence or credential use is claimed.

Owner-requested [MAXIMUM-AUTHORITY](designs/MAXIMUM-AUTHORITY.md) adds five indexed APPROVED / NOT IMPLEMENTED units CAP-1..CAP-5 and explicit acceptance: operation-level inventory, Standard Full setup/diagnostics, secure additional credentials, advanced enterprise/package/App gaps and independent verification. Ordinary owner setup already offers Full and defaults to Everyday; the new plan improves accessibility/parity without silently widening existing grants. 98.3% is retired as functional coverage; no such current tracked claim was located. GitHub Models is retired July 30, 2026; audit/package auth support must be reconciled per operation. 411 catalog tools do not prove endpoint coverage.

Next: retain existing eligible acceptance and PUB-4 priority; execute CAP-1 before dependent maximum-authority implementation, independently of publication-only PUB-5. This PR is explicitly requested design maintenance: zero production lines, zero completed implementation subsections, no release, spend or provider-account mutation. Required checks, self-review and exact-head CI/release-policy precede merge.

## Release acceptance queue — workflow optimization 2026-10-14

Owner-authorized guidance/tooling maintenance: consolidated session procedure, focused
checks between meaningful edits, substantial capability grouping, and read-only queued
acceptance/PR-boundary report. This records source/tooling work, not a live/provider pass.
The queue below seeds existing outstanding obligations; reconcile exact scenarios and
already-proven evidence from the unchanged cards/ledger before running. Keep all prior
open obligations, original fixture ownership, approvals and deployment provenance.
