# Design — Batch C: Cheap on context (small results, compact listing, budgets)

Status: **DRAFT — awaiting Chris's approval (IN-00)**. Written 2026-10-10. Scope and acceptance: `docs/PLAN.md` →
Batch C. Cards C-1, C-2. Depends on Batch B. Every later tool is built to these rules, so this batch comes before any
area tools.

Why: a 300-tool server listed the ordinary way costs tens of thousands of tokens before an agent does anything, and
GitHub's objects are large (a pull request object is ~25 KB, a run log can be megabytes, a diff unbounded). Same
approach as the Stripe MCP (its `docs/designs/BATCH-C.md`): tool search, progressive disclosure, small results, handles,
workflows, annotations.

## 0. Verify before starting

| # | Assumption | How to check |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | The MCP SDK in `package.json` supports tool `annotations`, `outputSchema` and `structuredContent` | `grep -rn "outputSchema\|annotations" node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/types.d.ts \| head` |
| C2 | Each tool module exports registry metadata (`area`, `profiles`, `writes`, `production`, `cred`) from Batch B | `grep -n "writes:" src/tools/*.js \| head` |

## 1. Decisions

**C1. Two listing modes per connection.** `catalog` (default for claude.ai, whose client does tool search): every tool in
the profile, listing description ≤160 characters starting with the action (`PRODUCTION:` first for `Prod` tools,
`SPENDS MONEY:` first for `$` tools); longer guidance lives in property descriptions and `github_describe_tool`.
`compact` (default for every other client): the meta-tools, `github_whoami`, `github_api_search`/`github_graphql_read` (once Batch U
exists) and the `github_workflow_*` tools — about 25 tools, under 5,000 tokens, reaching everything.

**C2. Meta-tools.** `github_search_tools(query, area?, audience?, limit=10)` → names, one-line descriptions, safety marks;
`github_describe_tool(name)` → full schema and guidance; `github_call(name, args)` → dispatches into the **wrapped**
handler, so every guard applies; `github_batch(calls[≤10])` → reads only; `github_get_result(handle, page?, fields?)`.

**C3. Small results by default.** Every read tool gets `detail: 'summary'|'full'` (default summary) and `fields` (dotted
paths) from a registry layer. One summary mapper per GitHub object type in `src/tools/summaries.js` (6–14 fields a person
reads): repository, branch, commit, compare, pull request, review, review thread, issue, comment, label, milestone,
workflow, run, job, check run, status, artifact, release, deployment, environment, webhook, delivery, alert, member,
team, invitation, installation, budget/usage line, codespace. Lists return one page (default 20, max 100) with `next`.

**C4. Big text is capped, never dumped.** Bodies, comments, patches, diffs, file contents and logs carry a
`textLimit` (default 4,000 characters per field, 400 lines for logs) and say how much was left out; the rest is behind a
handle. Logs are summarised server-side (failing steps, error lines, annotations) — never base64 (audit G5).

**C5. Size cap and handles.** A result over 8 KB returns the first part, a count, a one-line summary ("37 open PRs, 4
failing CI, 2 drafts") and a handle `res_…`, kept 24 hours in `result_store`, readable only by the same connection or
pass.

**C6. Annotations and structured output.** Every tool sets `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`,
`openWorldHint` from its metadata. Workflow tools declare `outputSchema` and return `structuredContent` plus a short
plain-English text line.

**C7. Budgets are tests.** `scripts/check-budgets.mjs` (in `npm run check`) fails when: compact listing ≥5,000 tokens;
`everyday` catalog listing ≥22,000; any listing description >160 characters; any schema ≥1,500 tokens; any read tool's
default response on its 100-item fixture >8 KB without a handle. Token counts use a pinned tokenizer package and are
printed in CI.

## 2. Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS result_store (handle TEXT PRIMARY KEY, connection TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(), expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL, summary TEXT, body JSONB NOT NULL);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS result_store_expires ON result_store (expires_at);
```

Expired rows are deleted by the request path (`DELETE … WHERE expires_at < now()` limited to 100 rows), no cron.

## 4. Work units

### C-1 — Summaries, fields, detail, text caps, handles, annotations (M)
Files: `src/tools/summaries.js`, `src/core/result-rules.js`, `src/db.js`, `src/tools/server.js` (`github_get_result`).
Tests: field projection and unknown-path note; text cap reports what was cut; handle isolation between connections;
annotation consistency with metadata; size cap on fixtures.

### C-2 — Listing modes, meta-tools, budgets (M) — may group with C-1
Files: `src/core/meta.js`, `api/mcp.js` (listing per connection, `?listing=` override), `scripts/check-budgets.mjs`.
Tests: `github_call` passes the write-contract helper (door #2); refuses tools outside the profile; `github_batch`
refuses writes; budget script fails on a planted 161-character description (prove once).

## 5. Stop-and-ask points

1. The SDK lacks annotations or structured output (C1 false): build the rest; record the gap; amend.

## 6. Acceptance mapping

| PLAN Batch C line | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Compact <5k, everyday catalog <22k tokens | CI budget output |
| Every door enforces the same guards | write-contract through `github_call` |
| Handles isolated; text capped | `tests/db/result-store.test.js`, `tests/unit/result-rules.test.js` |
