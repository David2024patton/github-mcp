# ROADMAP — ideas not being built now

## Owner-approved completion expansion (2026-10-18): PUBLIC-SCALE, NOT PUBLISHED

The owner explicitly requires GitHub MCP to support **both mobile and desktop** and to be **architected and verified for potential permitted multi-user scale**, while **all plugins and public enrollment stay PRIVATE** until production readiness and a separate owner publication decision. This is a binding completion requirement, not permission to expose the existing global-admin single-owner setup to outside users. The indexed APPROVED (PUB-1..PUB-4) and publication-BLOCKED (PUB-5) security-first architecture and ordered PUB-1 through PUB-5 workstreams are in [PUBLIC-SCALE](designs/PUBLIC-SCALE.md). Before any implementation, write full PUB cards/acceptance into the work index and commit the prescribed plan, preserve all existing 57 original acceptance rows and developer $0/release policies. This cross-product expansion does not make original source-only tests or the new design a real-world acceptance pass. Neither the desktop direct plugin nor the Sites mobile candidate has passed dual-device acceptance.



Not approved scope. An item moves into a design only with Chris's approval (a dated DECISIONS entry). The usual signal
for hand-building something is repeated `github_api_*` / `github_graphql_*` calls for it in the change log.

- **Self-hosted and larger runners** (`github_runner_*`): hosted runners are spend; reached by the universal tools
  meanwhile (classified as spend).
- **Merge queue** tools: Chris merges with merge commits at the exact head and does not use a merge queue.
- **Copilot coding agent, Copilot review requests, Copilot Spaces, premium-request reports** as hand-built tools, if Chris
  returns to Copilot (cancelled 2026-10-09). Seat billing tools exist already (O-4).
- **Organization issue types, issue fields, autolinks, interaction limits, SBOM and attestations, migrations, Classroom**
  as hand-built tools.
- **GitHub Models:** retired July 30, 2026 according to [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models); no new catalog/inference tools planned. This supersedes the historical D1 “belongs with Hub model servers” exclusion.
- **Enterprise features and maximum authority:** moved into approved [CAP-1..CAP-5](designs/MAXIMUM-AUTHORITY.md). A developer account lacking Enterprise does not exclude Enterprise users from the product. Provider plan/role/credential constraints are operation-specific.
- **Move a secret from another service into GitHub** (e.g. a Neon connection string or a Vercel token into an Actions
  secret) without it passing through chat: a hub workflow across servers, not built here.
- **Browser-assisted dashboard steps:** for settings GitHub has no API for, an agent with a browser follows
  `github_where_is_setting`'s structured steps while Chris watches; the server then reads back where possible.
- **Move to a newer REST API version** when GitHub publishes one after `2026-03-10` (its own card with a review of
  GitHub's breaking-changes page).
- **Reacting to repository events** (the App subscribing to push, pull request or check events, e.g. to tell Chris when
  CI fails on `main`): the server only handles installation events today.
- **A scheduled GitHub digest** (failing CI on default branches, new alerts, pending invitations, spend) once scheduled
  tasks are in regular use; `github_workflow_weekly_digest` is the on-demand version.
- **Port fixes back** to the Stripe and Workspace servers when a copied contract file is improved here (until the hub's
  `robinson-mcp-core` package exists).
- **More project profiles** (YardSync, Cortiware) when their repositories exist; `github_profile_draft` drafts them.

- Show a server-generated secret value once on the one-time-secret page when Chris asks (G-3 follow-up; today a generated value is never visible).


**2026-10-16:** the items in this file that Batch Y now plans (self-hosted/larger runners, merge queue, Copilot agent and Spaces, org issue types and fields, autolinks, interaction limits, SBOM/attestations, migrations) are scheduled in `docs/designs/BATCH-Y.md`; money-related ones wait for IN-16.

## Backlog carried from CAP-4 closeout (2026-10-22)

Not scheduled; each is built as a whole outcome only when an owner workflow asks: packages/registry streaming; credential
administration beyond SAML revocation; remaining GitHub App lifecycle routes (suspend/unsuspend, installation listing);
curated tools with write specifications for the 234 GraphQL mutations the inventory marks `blocked-missing-write-spec` (the universal tool does not cover them); enterprise audit/SCIM/IP policy once an enterprise principal exists.

## Approved by Chris 2026-10-23: public-friendly connection (scheduled before PUB-5, after testing is finished)

Order: finish the remaining acceptance testing first, then this, then PUB-5. Build it as one whole outcome, not slivers.

- **Simple connect flow for anyone:** Connect, Sign in with GitHub, pick the account, Approve. Mode, profile and tool listing default to safe **Two tiers (owner design 2026-10-23):** normal sign-in unlocks everything sign-in alone can authorize; an optional "God mode" step on the same screen collects the extra tokens/secrets for the rest. See `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
  choices and move to a settings page. No administrator passphrase for ordinary users. Today's owner form stays for the owner.
  Decided by Chris 2026-10-23: the simple flow is the normal way to connect. Today's owner form (account, mode, profile, tool listing, passphrase)
  becomes development-only: kept for building and testing, not shown to ordinary users, and out of the product's normal path.
- **GitHub App install inside the connect flow:** after "Sign in with GitHub", the server checks which accounts the person has already installed
  the App on; for an account without it, it sends them straight to GitHub's install screen (with "request user authorization during
  installation" so sign-in and install are one step) and returns them to finish connecting. Organizations whose owner must approve the install
  show a plain "waiting for your organization owner" state. Needs the App to be publicly installable (a GitHub App setting), which is a
  distribution step that needs Chris's explicit approval before it is switched on. Today's one-by-one "Create the GitHub App" step stays for the owner and self-hosting.
- **Easy place to add the extra tokens and secrets** that the standard GitHub sign-in cannot reach (for example the package token,
  notifications token, fine-grained tokens): a guided "Unlock more tools" page that says, in plain words, which tools each one opens, how to
  create it on GitHub step by step, accepts it on the protected page only (never through chat or a tool argument), shows what it unlocked,
  and lets the user remove it. Builds on the existing encrypted token vault and CAP-3 enrollment; the no-secret-through-a-tool rule stays.
- Acceptance: a first-time user on a phone connects without help, sees which tools are available and which need an extra token,
  adds one token, and sees those tools unlock; verified on real devices.

### Public App rollout plan (Chris approved the approach 2026-10-23; built after testing, before PUB-5)

Approach: one public GitHub App, opened gradually. Every item below is part of "done"; agents do all of it except the rows that only Chris can do
(listed in `docs/OWNER-CHECKLIST.md`).

1. **Connect flow and token page** (the two items above), with the owner form kept development-only.
2. **App settings completed for public use:** name, description, logo, homepage, support contact, setup and callback addresses, webhook address and
   secret, the smallest permission set that still works (extra permissions requested only when a person asks for those tools), "request user
   authorization during installation", and "installable by any account" switched on only at launch, with Chris's say-so.
3. **Key and secret safety:** the App private key, client secret and webhook secret held only in server settings, never logged; a documented,
   rehearsed way to replace each one fast; webhook signatures always checked.
4. **Capacity and cost:** load test with many simulated users; per-user limits and caps confirmed; a monthly hosting-cost view with an alert
   threshold; clear plain-words limits shown to users. Pricing is a later decision for Chris.
5. **Safety for strangers' accounts:** every action stays inside the person's own installation and the permissions they approved; a one-click
   "disconnect and delete my data" for users; removal of stored tokens when an App is uninstalled.
6. **Legal and trust pages:** terms of service, privacy policy, a security contact and a status/support page. Agents draft them; Chris decides and
   a lawyer should review (agents are not lawyers).
7. **Gradual opening:** invite-only first (a handful of people), watch errors, cost and support questions, then widen. Each step needs Chris's go-ahead.
8. **Honest acceptance:** a first-time user on a phone connects, installs the App, adds an extra token and sees tools unlock, checked on real
   devices, plus the load test result, before the setting is switched on.

## Remaining after PUB-6 (named, not built)
- Make the GitHub App publicly installable and turn on `GITHUB_PUBLIC_CONNECT` (needs Chris's go-ahead; see the rollout plan above).
- (Done 2026-10-23) The old "make changes" tick-box became an optional **Read-only** choice: changes are on by default, and a read-only connection refuses changes with wording that says how to reconnect.
- Fine-grained-token tenants (God mode currently offers the notifications and package keys).
- Revoke or delete a stranger's tenant and data by identity (today's revoke tools are keyed by account for the private pilot).
- Self-host the brand fonts (pages currently use system fonts) and a favicon `.ico`.
- Move the connector to `github.robinsonaisystems.com` (OAuth callbacks, App settings, existing clients; DNS row on the owner checklist).
- Real-device acceptance of the new flow (owner checklist, optional).

- (Done 2026-10-23) Self-serve "delete my data" page for public people: sign in with GitHub, confirm once, everything stored is removed.

## Owner-requested (2026-10-23) — status
- (Done 2026-10-23, GOD-1) God mode as one master token. Remaining God-mode work is planned in FIN cards GOD-2..GOD-5
  and ENT-1 (`docs/designs/FINISH-PLAN.md`).
- (Historical note) **God mode as ONE master token:** Chris's intent is a single classic GitHub token, typed on the God page (never into a chat), that unlocks everything the standard sign-in cannot: notifications, packages and every other classic-token-only operation — instead of today's separate "notifications token" / "package token" choices. Needs a design: one new credential kind that existing notification/package tools also accept, the token scopes to tell the person to tick, encrypted storage like the current keys, and tools for the remaining classic-only operations.
- **Linking a second, separate GitHub login** into one connection (security-sensitive: needs sign-in as both people). Today each GitHub person gets their own separate space.

- Link a second, separate GitHub login (for example a client's or an older work login) into one connection. Needs proof of both logins and a careful look at tenant isolation. Not built; one login with its personal account and organizations is covered.

## Found during the 2026-10-23 sign-in rebuild (now planned: stateless/cap → HARD-1 A.1, one App key copy → HARD-1 A.2)
- **Stateless sign-in steps:** every sign-in step is a database row under one global cap (200 open), so anyone opening many
  sign-in links could briefly fill it. Signing the step into the address itself (and recording only used ones) would remove the cap.
- **One copy of the App keys:** each person's area keeps its own sealed copy of the App's keys, refreshed at their next
  sign-in. Reading the single shared copy instead would make a key change reach everyone at once.
- **Second GitHub login in one connection** (above) would fit naturally on My connection once tenant merging is designed.

## Planned 2026-10-23 (batch FIN, see docs/designs/FINISH-PLAN.md)
GOD-2 personal tools on the master token · GOD-3 "what it unlocks" · ENT-1 enterprise tools (trial) · ACC-1 acceptance
sweep · GOD-4 new master-token families · GQL-1 GraphQL write specs · GOD-5 extra places · HARD-1 hardening and tidy.
Still NOT planned (stay here): PUB-5 directory listing (policy-blocked); linking a second, separate GitHub login into one
connection; OAuth-app token management and App-manifest conversion (need an OAuth app's own secret).
