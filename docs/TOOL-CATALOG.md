<!-- Native MCP tools/list catalog is complete across standard nextCursor pages (40 tools/page). Its original 22,000-token ceiling applies to each complete response; meta search/describe/call remain available independently. Implemented in F-1 PR #167 with real issue capabilities. -->
# Tool catalog

OAuth credential maintenance (A-5/Y-9, PR #258): user authorization refresh is cross-instance claimed and bounded; the existing `github_sponsor_get` read verifies the payer once for its typed relationship and tier inventories. No tool, credential permission, safety category, catalog count or end-user capability changed.

Restricted preview RTC successful replies revalidate service pass and scratch ownership at send time (#150), without an extra rate unit. Restricted preview RTC search/describe tool metadata is size-bounded to 8192 UTF-8 bytes. Oversized catalog pages and schemas are retained whole under connection-owned 24-hour result handles (#149), without expanding independent MCP tool authority.

Every tool this server will have, by area — the product scope. The implementing model builds exactly these; anything
else goes in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and the PR report, and universal tools (last section) provide guarded access only where their actual credential, classification and request support permits. Endpoint-level completeness remains unproven; see [MAXIMUM-AUTHORITY](designs/MAXIMUM-AUTHORITY.md). Counts are checked by `python3 scripts/count-catalog.py` (run by `npm run check` and CI since A-1, #1). When a
tool merges, its Card cell gains `built #<PR>`. Built so far: **411 cataloged tools** (every row below is in the registry, `src/tools/index.js`; `scripts/count-catalog.py` and `scripts/check-writes.mjs` fail the build if a tool and its row disagree)
and holds the two A-5 tools, the B-3 protected-list reader the two B-2 production-switch tools and the B-4 spend-limit tool. Since B-5 every result of these tools is shaped (`src/tools/util.js`) and failures are explained by `src/tools/errors.js`. Since B-6 a connection sees only the tools its profile allows (`tools/list` and by-name calls). Every write tool below is built with `defineGithubWrite` (B-1, #16, `src/tools/define-github-write.js`) and pass the nine write-contract checks (`test/helpers/write-contract.js`); the two B-2 tools are the first (`src/tools/server.js`).

**Safety** (enforced by the trust layer, `docs/designs/BATCH-B.md`):
`—` reads only · `P` preview available (`dryRun`), no confirmation needed for ordinary targets · `C` always needs
`confirm: true` · `D` destructive or irreversible · `Prod` always production (needs a production connection and
`confirm`) · `Prod*` production only when the target is (default branch, protected branch, production environment, org
scope — B-2 decides) · `A` widens someone's access (always `confirm`; `A*` only for some uses, e.g. making something
public) · `M` notifies people (`confirm` when it reaches anyone outside Chris's own accounts; B-4) · `$` raises spend
(dollar estimate, `confirm`, refused while the account's spend limit is $0; `$*` only for some uses).

**Origin:** `C` the old toolkit had it (`robinsons-toolkit-mcp` namespace `github`; port to the new conventions, never
copy code) · `F` the old toolkit had it **with a bug or a missing guard**, fixed here (`docs/audits/2026-10-10-research.md`
§2) · `N` new.
**Cred** (which credential GitHub accepts for it, `docs/designs/BATCH-A.md` A5): `I` the GitHub App installation token
(default) · `U` Chris's user authorization of the App (personal settings and a few user-only operations) · `I,U` either ·
`P` the optional classic package token (package routes only) · `K` the optional classic token (notifications only) · `—` no GitHub call.
**Audience** (contract §3): `B` builder · `O` owner/administrator · `Op` day-to-day operator.
**Profile:** `R` read_only and up · `E` everyday and up · `F` full only.

**Names:** every tool starts with the service prefix `github_` (`github_<area>_<verb>`; DECISIONS 2026-10-10), so it
never collides with the Vercel or Neon server's tools in the same chat; `scripts/count-catalog.py` enforces it.

Card(s): G-3. Covers Actions, Dependabot, Codespaces and agent secrets at repository, environment and organization level, and (GOD-4) your own personal Codespaces secrets with `level: user` and `kind: codespaces` — those use your master token (codespace permission) and are refused in plain words without it. **Secret values never pass through a tool:** Chris types them on the setup page, or the server generates them.

## Developer tools (`github_dev_*`) — 15

Card(s): V-1 … V-5. The owner alone can enable an exact Organization as `is_scratch` through the authenticated setup page after live All-repositories App verification; no connection/tool argument can elevate this flag. Preview-only (contract §10): every `github_dev_*` tool refuses production targets before reading anything, records every object it creates in a run, and tags it `rtc_run=<runId>` (`docs/designs/BATCH-V.md`).

## Owner: apps and fine-grained tokens (`github_app_*, github_tokenpolicy_*`) — 7

Card(s): O-5. Source built in PR #203 with scoped metadata projections, U-credential installation repository changes and three-door guarded PAT approval/revocation. Live custom-MCP acceptance remains pending release and owner authorization; raw token values are never surfaced. Some GitHub plans/credential types do not permit these operations, and the server fails closed rather than claiming unsupported write success.

## Owner: personal account (`github_account_*`) — 14

Card(s): O-6. Source built in PR #204 with verified user-auth principal, real profile/email/public-key/block/invitation operations and full guarded-write lifecycle. Needs a user authorization (`U`); installation tokens cannot reach personal settings. Raw public key material is accepted only for additions but never returned in inventory. Provider acceptance and real email confirmation remain separate.

## Owner: notifications and gists (`github_notify_*, github_gist_*`) — 7

Card(s): O-7. Source built in PR #205. Notifications require optional classic token (`K`, notifications scope); owner input IN-11 is **not** auto-approved or token-enrolled. Without K, return setup guidance only. All inbox/subscription writes are production-confirmed, user-scoped and journaled. Gists use user authorization (`U`), independently verified owner and bounded file contents. Provider/real-use acceptance awaits separate release and permissions.

## Owner and administration: guided settings (`github_admin_*`) — 3

Card(s): O-1. Every GitHub settings page is in the dashboard map (`src/data/dashboard-map.js`); settings with no API return structured steps from `github_where_is_setting` (contract §11).

O-1 source correction PR #257: user-profile links in both guided entrypoints derive the chosen account's enrolled personal OAuth principal, never its organization name. Unknown/mismatched personal identity returns a null link; navigation and manual-only settings never prove a completed change. The owner guide describes guarded end-user paid and destructive capability accurately instead of importing developer-only spending/deletion restrictions.

## Moderation and organization planning objects (`github_comment_*, github_org_issue_*`) — 16

Card(s): Y-5. Acts on text written by other people, so hiding and deleting always ask first and previews quote the text as untrusted data. GraphQL tools reuse the reviewed Y-2 write specs. Issue types and fields are organization-wide: every change asks first and deletes need the exact name and have no undo. Select-field options keep their ids unless named in `removeOptions`.

## Projects v2 lifecycle (`github_project_*`) — 15

Card(s): Y-4. GraphQL only. A project is named by owner and number; GitHub must confirm it belongs to a connected account. Organizations use the installation credential, personal accounts the user sign-in. Deletes need the exact title or are production-class and have no undo. Select-option edits resend every existing option with its id.

## Project profiles (`github_profile_*`) — 3

Card(s): P-1 … P-3. P-1 implementation in PR #206: additive, versioned known_projects persistence, two seeded policies and actual guard integration. These are read-only user tools, not granted GitHub write authority. Optional (docs/designs/BATCH-P.md). The readiness and setup workflows are listed under Workflows.

| `github_profile_draft` | Turn what an agent found in a codebase (workflows, branches, environments, required checks) into a draft profile and APP-NEEDS text | — | N | — | B,O | R | P-3 built #209 |

## Workflows (`github_workflow_*`) — 17

Card(s): P-2, P-3, W-1 … W-7. P-2 built in PR #207 as a non-read-only composed workflow: inspection is read-only, but a single explicitly named repair invokes an existing independently guarded write. Never claim unverified process rows or unreadable provider settings are healthy. Whole jobs in one call, answered in plain English with `structuredContent` (`docs/designs/BATCH-W.md`). W-3/W-4 add verified review disposition and CI recovery workflows; their genuine deployed acceptance remains queued. W-1 and W-2 were implemented together in PR #210; status is read-only, while open/merge workflows delegate to the existing journaled and independently guarded writers. A staged PR open or stack progresses one write at a time and requires a fresh call for the next step.

## Batch Y-9d financial and Copilot operations (`github_y9_*`) — 17

Y-9d is approved by IN-16. Every mutating call uses the existing production, pass, permission, protection, confirmation, cost and journal gates. Hosted-runner creation and agent task starting use supported GitHub APIs under delegated user authority, a truthful unbounded future metered cost warning and ordinary protected writes; no developer TEST acceptance spends money. Genuine live acceptance is tracked separately.

## Everything else on GitHub: the universal tools (`github_api_*, github_graphql_*`) — 6

Card(s): U-1, U-2.

| Tool | What it does | Safety | Origin | Cred | Audience | Profile | Card |

| `github_api_describe` | Parameters for one operation, trimmed, from GitHub's own description at the pinned version | — | N | — | B,O,Op | R | U-1 built #219 |

| `github_graphql_read` | Pinned-schema validated single GraphQL query, typed variables, scoped aliases/fragments/nodes and 500-point/500,000-node cap before sending | — | N | I,U | B,O,Op | R | U-2 built #220 |
| `github_graphql_write` | One reviewed GraphQL mutation (24 specs: pins, locks, minimize, discussions, linked branches, issue comments and delete, draft state, team review assignment; plus the legacy title and project-field shapes) with ownership proof, before/after read, always-confirmed journal and a recorded undo where one exists | C·Prod·A·M | N | I,U | B,O,Op | F | U-2 built #220 |

How `github_api_write` and `github_graphql_write` stay safe (`docs/designs/BATCH-U.md`):

- **Always `confirm: true`**, `dryRun` supported; the preview names the operation in plain words, the exact
  parameters, and the object as it is now when the path names one.
- **Only what GitHub describes.** Every request is checked against the vendored OpenAPI description (REST) or the
  vendored schema (GraphQL) at the pinned version; unknown operations, parameters or fields are refused in words.
- **Classification table** (`src/github/operation-classes.js`): production, access-widening, notifies-people and spend
  marks for every operation, seeded from GitHub's own `x-github.triggersNotification` flags and the guard rules of
  B-2/B-4. **An unlisted operation that creates, deletes, transfers, invites, enables, assigns seats or changes
  settings is treated as production + access-widening until classified** — the safe default.
- **Hand-built tools win**: if a hand-built tool covers the operation, the universal tool refuses and names it.
- **Never** `bypass_rules` (except GOD-6's deliberate `overrideRules` on the merge and file-write tools), never a secret value in a request (secret endpoints are refused; use `github_secret_set`), never
  a raw credential in a result.
- **What the universal tools cannot do (Y-1, stated plainly).** They act only on accounts this connection owns (a
  person or organization that is not enrolled is refused; following, starring and reading other accounts are Y-3).
  They send and receive JSON only: no raw/binary media types, custom headers, other base URLs or uploads (Y-8).
  A write whose route text matches a spend word (runners, retention, deployments, pages, packages, codespaces, Copilot,
  billing, code security, Marketplace) is refused with the spend message unless that exact route is in the reviewed
  free list (`src/github/spend-classes.js`: self-hosted runner and runner-group administration, OIDC customisation,
  deployment approvals, package delete/restore, Pages rebuild, artifact-metadata records). Hosted runners, retention
  and storage limits, Codespaces, Copilot and code-security configurations stay blocked because their cost cannot be
  computed. Gist routes (`/gists/*`) have no `/user` prefix, so they need the user credential (`cred: U`); the default
  installation credential cannot reach them. GraphQL writes are limited to the reviewed mutation specs in `src/github/graphql-writes.js`
  (Y-2: pinIssue/unpinIssue, pinIssueComment/unpinIssueComment, lockLockable/unlockLockable, minimizeComment/unminimizeComment,
  closeDiscussion/reopenDiscussion, updateDiscussion, updateDiscussionComment, deleteDiscussion, deleteDiscussionComment,
  markDiscussionCommentAsAnswer/unmark…, convertPullRequestToDraft/markPullRequestReadyForReview, createLinkedBranch/
  deleteLinkedBranch, updateIssueComment, deleteIssueComment, deleteIssue, updateTeamReviewAssignment) and the two legacy shapes
  (a string `title` change, one ProjectV2 field value). Any other mutation is refused with "use the specialised tool".
- Same production guard, self-protection, profile ownership, change log, read-back (`confirmed: null` when nothing
  can be read back), passes need `allow_writes`, `full` profile only.

## Things GitHub has no API for

Handled by `github_where_is_setting` with structured steps and, where GitHub lets the value be read, a read-back
(`github_admin_check_setting`); never faked: requiring two-factor authentication for an organization; SAML single sign-on
(Enterprise Cloud); changing the plan or buying seats for the plan; buying Marketplace apps; personal password, passkeys
and recovery codes; creating a GitHub App or OAuth app by hand (the setup page uses the manifest flow instead);
OAuth app access policy; fine-grained token policy for the organization; Copilot policies at the personal level;
notification email routing; the personal security log; Sponsors; deleting the organization or the account; transferring
an organization; scheduled reminders; interaction limits beyond 6 months. The full page-by-page map is built in O-1.

## Self-hosted runners and Actions administration (`github_runner_*, github_actions_set_limits`) — 12

Card(s): Y-6. Runner registration, removal and just-in-time tokens are sealed in the one-time store: the tool returns only the private setup-page address, never the token. Letting public repositories use a self-hosted runner is off by default and asks first with a plain warning. A busy runner is never removed. Raising a cache, size or artifact/log limit counts as spend (cost cannot be calculated) and is blocked while the spend limit is $0. `github_deploy_review_pending` is not built: `github_actions_review_pending_deployment` already does it.

## Security writes (`github_security_advisory_*, github_security_config_*`) — 12

Card(s): Y-7. Advisory text never appears in a result or the change log (only a SHA-256); publishing is public and irreversible and needs the GHSA id typed twice. Paid security features on private repositories are refused, not priced: code scanning default setup refuses private repositories and a configuration with paid settings only attaches to public repositories (`docs/DECISIONS.md` 2026-10-16). Not built: push-protection bypass review and advisory private forks (no route in the pinned description), and autofix (waits for the Y-8 jobs table).

## Background jobs, archives and autofix (`github_job_*, github_artifact_read, github_content_read_archive, github_security_*sbom*, github_code_scanning_autofix_*`) — 8

Card(s): Y-8. A slow GitHub operation returns a `job_id` at once; `github_job_status` asks GitHub once per call (not more than every 10 seconds) and never waits, and the finished result is kept as an ordinary result handle. Artifacts and repository snapshots are opened on the server (50 MB zipped, 200 MB unpacked, 500 files, no unsafe names or links); binary files show only name, size and SHA-256 and the signed download address is never returned. `github_release_upload_asset` also accepts a build artifact (`artifactId`, optional `entry`) as its source. Wiki editing is in its own section below.

| Tool | What it does | Safety | Origin | Cred | Audience | Profile | Card |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `github_code_scanning_autofix_commit` | Commit a ready suggested fix to a named branch | C·Prod* | N | I | B,Op | F | Y-8 |

## Wiki (`github_wiki_*`) — 3

Card(s): Y-8 (WU-Y8d), owner decision IN-17 = yes (2026-10-16). GitHub has no wiki API, so the server speaks git to `<repo>.wiki.git` in memory only (`isomorphic-git` + `memfs`, pinned), through the injected fetch: only that path on github.com is reachable, redirects are refused, the installation token is the HTTP password and never appears in a URL, result or log. Limits: 200 pages, 5 MB, 1 MB per page, 20 MB transfer. The first page of a new wiki must be saved in the browser (guide `repo-wiki-edit`).

## Organization administration extras (`github_org_security_manager_set, github_org_network_config_*, github_org_migration_*`) — 5

Card(s): Y-9 (WU-Y9a). Organization-level, so every write is production-class and confirmed. Network configurations need Enterprise Cloud and answer `not_available_on_plan` otherwise. A migration archive holds private data: the server never downloads or relays it (status points to the browser download). `github_credential_report_leak` is not built (the endpoint receives the secret itself; a guide covers revoking on github.com).

| `github_org_migration_status` | State of an organization migration and where to download the archive (uses your master token when added) | — | N | I | O,Op | R | Y-9 |

## CAP-4 governed organization and App JWT lifecycle (`github_org_audit_read, github_org_scim_*, github_org_saml_*, github_app_*`) — 15

Card(s): CAP-4. Read-only, account-bound organization audit and SAML-SSO SCIM identity visibility. Cursor output is verified against exact GitHub.com organization and SCIM equality filters are constrained to provider-documented fields. GitHub plan/role/SSO/permission is verified by provider; 403/404 are not guessed plan limitations. Enterprise-managed-user SCIM and enterprise audit are distinct unresolved authority paths. Each page is bounded; SCIM emails and raw audit fields are not echoed.

## GitHub Enterprise (`github_enterprise_*`) — 13

Card(s): ENT-1. Every tool uses the person's **master token** (credential `M`, with enterprise permissions) and only for an enterprise the person administers (`github_enterprise_list`); nothing is sent for any other slug. Not available on read-only connections or passes. Writes are always production-class and confirmed, and are read back from GitHub. Not built: the Copilot coding-agent policy write, because GitHub's description has no operation that reads that policy back; it stays reachable through the universal REST tool. Membership changes (admins, members, organizations) are not in this set.

## Master-token families: Copilot Spaces, Classroom, Marketplace and more (`github_copilot_space_*, github_classroom_*, ...`) — 17

Card(s): GOD-4 (part B). Every tool here uses your master token (the permission named in the tool), and answers in plain words when it is missing. Copilot Spaces are your own (`{username}` is always the token's owner). GitHub has closed the Classroom service, so those four reads usually answer "not available" honestly. Not built here: `github_credential_revoke` (needs its own protected one-use token page; listed as the remaining part of GOD-4).

## Totals

**Totals:** 463 tools: 457 hand-built + 6 universal (`github_api_*`, `github_graphql_*`), plus guided settings for every
dashboard-only owner setting. By profile (lowest profile that has the tool): read_only 154, everyday adds 81
(everyday lists 234), full adds 112 (full lists 389). In compact mode (`docs/designs/BATCH-C.md`) an agent
loads only about 25 tools up front (meta-tools, whoami, universal search, workflows) and reaches the rest through
`github_search_tools` / `github_call`.

<!-- #108: experimental RTC HTTPS reader bridges only server/meta read tools using existing guarded dispatch; RTC 1 certification is not claimed. -->

<!-- #110: RTC pass-issued server/meta reads have persistent immutable no-writes / $0 scopes; large result handle is top-level for Hub SDK. Full RTC 1 remains incomplete. -->

RTC output safety (#143): every canonical tool reply/error uses shared provider/RTC redaction; remaining credential-shaped deep values or keys are refused before result retention. No catalog or grant expansion.

Scratch cleanup: confirmed repository disposal includes unchanged creation-bound initial labels; it never asserts their creator or authorizes standalone default-label deletion. See pr-cards/SCRATCH-CONTAINER-LABELS.md.

Package credential routing: G-6 personal metadata/version/lifecycle tools use the authenticated `/user/packages` namespace with verified enrolled personal actor; organization tools retain `/orgs/{org}/packages`. All org, named-user and authenticated-user package delete/restore routes are curated-first in universal REST and cannot bypass specialized guards. Removal through protected setup does not require decrypting a stored token.

O-1 personal-status read uses genuine enrolled U for GET /user, checks exact stored identity and exposes only id/login plus optional 2FA/plan. Missing/revoked/foreign U remains unreadable, never replaced by I. Omitted personal settings remain unknown; this is not a full personal security review or completion of guided browser controls.

B-5 provider permission hints: only explicit read/write/admin entries are eligible. Permissionless boolean metadata and the known unselectable organization_packages key never become approval instructions. Genuine entries are compared conditionally with actual grants, target access and supported token types; an integration refusal alone does not prove missing owner consent. HTTP/request details and actual denial are retained.
