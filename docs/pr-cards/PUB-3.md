# PUB-3 — Private tenant capacity, abuse controls and incident isolation

**Stage: PUB-3 source implementation completed on PR #267; live/mobile/provider acceptance independent; merge requires final exact-head green CI/review**. Source baseline `3c68af7dfe0a2352d53f490a395908bc3b2be260`. Existing private tenant OAuth was merged in PR #264; no live/private device acceptance is asserted. Keep plugins private and do not create a customer signup or pay for load testing.

## Drift check A — shared caller paths and safety policy

- Existing GitHub rate limiter `src/github/rate.js` uses **per-tenant isolated database** for per-account/installation provider blocks; owner global legacy path unchanged. Private tenant aggregate budgets and abuse limits are missing.
- Existing `src/db.js` result_store and gh_async_jobs retain 24-hour entries, but have no per-tenant storage ceiling/concurrency cap. Private namespaces already isolate all tables; avoid weakening provider permissions or user abilities to solve capacity.
- Existing `api/mcp.js`, `src/tenancy/mcp-route.js`, `src/tenancy/oauth-token.js`, OAuth and job start/result read seams are available. Limit only after verified tenant resolution; unauthenticated abuse receives refusal with no owner database fallback.
- Keep private tenant opt-in OFF by default. App storage/limits are separate from product spending caps and the developer's $0 execution budget. Existing owner may choose additional user-authorized capabilities.
- Do not add PII/credentials to telemetry; redact errors categorically; use opaque event/operation classes and bounded duration histograms.

## Original whole PUB-3 acceptance

1. [x] Every active private tenant has atomic, independently configurable Postgres-backed account/connection request budgets and failure-path burst defenses across multiple Vercel instances; a burst by tenant A never consumes tenant B's counters or lets unauthorized calls reach GitHub.
2. [x] Existing jobs, retained results and GitHub API access obey tested per-tenant/per-client bounded concurrency, size, lifetime and stored-row caps; expired records are reclaimed safely without deleting live work or data belonging to another tenant.
3. [x] An authenticated tenant revoke/suspend/cancel makes further private traffic fail closed, including already-issued bearer refresh, outstanding jobs and result reads; previous and other tenants' data remains confidential.
4. [x] Private operational metrics record bounded nonsecret rate decisions, request duration buckets, OAuth/refresh outcome classes and service/provider failures with no tokens, credentials, private repository content, raw URL queries, email or user-provided error strings.
5. [x] Real disposable PostgreSQL two-tenant tests exercise concurrent requests, duplicate submissions, quota recovery, malicious/oversized payloads, tenant revocation, retention deletion and provider failure; unit/shape/RTC/CI and release-policy remain intact.
6. [x] Current legacy owner path, all end-user delegated GitHub capabilities and production/approval/spend/protected-resource rules stay unchanged; operational fair-use limits are explicitly disclosed and must not silently impose the developer agent's $0 testing policy on customers.

## Implementation / proof plan

Atomic fixed-window tenant and per-connection quota claims in a shared per-tenant PostgreSQL schema, implemented with parameterized single-statement upsert and strong scoped keys. A reserved slot counts even if GitHub refuses; honest retry metadata. Bound concurrent jobs by tenant and client with read-before-insert prevented by a lock; cap retained result bytes/count while allowing normal shaped pagination. Expired results/jobs removed in bounded batches without touching active records. Telemetry uses predefined event types, coarse duration buckets, no raw bearer/url/errors or content, and a 24-hour retention cut.

Stress the real DB with concurrent two-tenant connections and the same IDs to prove separate quotas; verify rollback/retry, no job oversubscription, throttled cleanups and revocation. Validate all existing write and OAuth tests and both full unit shards. Update docs/STATUS.md, owner guide, roadmap, risk/decision notes and record line counts. No external runtime config, paid capacity, public listing or live write.

## Source verification and security closeout — 2026-10-19

Implementation head `49ee0e1aa1b6e8eca012651e3451662cf1f16c54` passed full `ci 39352668681` including check, two unit shards, disposable PostgreSQL, shapes, RTC; `Daily live policy 39352668770` passed. Initial red CI diagnosed a corrupted duplicate source module, then a test counting an earlier tenant job as the same client's slot; both corrected without reducing quota enforcement or suppressing tests. Later real PostgreSQL verified per-tenant owner budget configuration and owner-only cleanup preserving another tenant. Source commits and tests do NOT establish real GitHub mobile/desktop acceptance or public scale readiness. No live deployment/pilot enablement or extra spending.

1. **Source proof:** Actual isolated Postgres capacity functions claim tenant and per-client counters atomically inside rollback-on-refusal SQL subtransactions; two independent connections exercise races; private request and OAuth routes gate before provider/dispatch; a protected owner form configures scoped request budgets. `tests/db/pub-3-runtime.test.js`; CI 39352668681 passed.

2. **Source proof:** Scoped job/result store wrapper validates max TTL, body bytes, daily usage and active reservation slots; concurrent Postgres claims refuse over limit; expiry cleanup uses bounded deletes; independent tenant B untouched; real DB and unit regression; CI 39352668681 passed.

3. **Source proof:** Existing signed tenant access checks owner/allowlist on each request; protected owner action revokes first, then private incident cleanup clears oauth clients/codes, bearer grants, jobs and retained results via one scoped statement. New real DB test forbids nonowner cleanup, verifies disabled tenant A, preserves tenant B, and CI 39352668681 passed.

4. **Source proof:** Record only fixed event, outcome and coarse latency buckets; private MCP/OAuth/refresh and provider transport events are emitted with redacted tenant SQL. Tests reject raw user-provided errors/URLs/token values and prove successful/refused/provider-failure class counts; CI 39352668681 passed.

5. **Source proof:** Two-tenant disposable Postgres checks overlapping clients and key names, atomic racing claims, independent counters, retained limits, TTL, tenant-local revocation/cleanup; unit tests check limits, malformed inputs and secrets; exact-head CI 39352668681 and daily policy 39352668770 passed on implementation head. Final docs-only head still needs new exact-head CI.

6. **Source proof:** Only PRIVATE tenant API and protected owner form changed. Legacy owner route bypasses tenant fair-use controls; original write/production/spend/approval/protected-resource rules unchanged. Private pilot OFF unless separately configured; no capacity purchase, public App enrollment, manual release or provider write. Source audit and green CI required after final doc commit.

**Outcome:** one original PUB-3 engineering subsection; the original 57-row provider acceptance remains unchanged (14 passed, 28 pending, 15 blocked, with 2 optional Hub-only rows). PRIVATE owner and GitHub safeguards retained. Exact HEAD after documentation reconcile still requires GitHub Actions green and reviewer threads resolved before merge.
