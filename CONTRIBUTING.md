# Contributing to Robinson GitHub MCP

The maintainer welcomes proposed improvements from people who have
permission to access the repository. A pull request is a **proposal**,
not approval to merge, deploy, distribute, or change project policy.

## Propose a change

1. Work in a feature branch or authorized fork; target `main`. Never
   push directly to `main` or `live`.
2. Describe the issue, proposed fix and expected behavior. Add or update
   tests and documentation when appropriate.
3. Declare implications for authentication, credentials, permissions,
   paid services, CI minutes, production deployment, or migration.
4. Do not submit passwords, tokens, private data or materials you lack
   the rights to contribute. Identify third-party materials and licenses.

## Independent maintainer decision

The maintainer or authorized reviewer examines the actual diff and may
accept, request changes, split, or reject it. Neither contributor status
nor passing tests causes automatic adoption. Starting an outside fork's
GitHub Actions run permits **testing only**, not approval of code.

An accepted PR must satisfy [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), required `ci` and
`release-policy` checks green at the exact reviewed head, resolved
review requirements and the repository's protected branch policy.
The independently scheduled release process governs `live`.

Each person retains the rights to their own contributions except to the
extent otherwise agreed. If incorporating a contribution requires an
additional copyright license or permission, resolve it before merging.
The repository's current no-open-source-license position is described
in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
