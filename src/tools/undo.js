// switch, protected list, people/spend gates, preview/confirm, request key and change-log row all apply again.
// An undo is therefore an ordinary change with its own recorded opposite (undo of an undo works), and a change that was
// overtaken by a later change to the same thing is refused rather than overwritten.
