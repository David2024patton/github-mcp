// The GitHub App manifest (BATCH-A A4/A5): one list of permissions, reviewed in this file, posted to GitHub by the owner's
// browser. GitHub then redirects back with a one-hour code that the server exchanges for the App's key and secrets.
//
// Permission names: every name below appears in GitHub's `server-to-server-permissions.json` (github/docs @ be38ec5d,
// `src/github-apps/data/fpt-2026-03-10/`) and, where the REST description's `app-permissions` schema also has it, spells it
// identically (`tests/unit/app-manifest.test.js` checks both). Account-level (user) permissions are NOT requested yet: that file
// and the REST description name several of them differently (`emails` / `email_addresses`, `keys` / `git_ssh_keys`), and GitHub
// rejects a manifest with an unknown name. Batch O adds them in its own card, verified then (DECISIONS 2026-10-10).
// Y-1 (DECISIONS 2026-10-16): account permissions stay out of the manifest because they cannot be verified without a real
// GitHub round trip; they are reached through the OAuth user route (credential U) and the owner checklist
// (`app-permissions-review` in the dashboard map). `repository_advisories` is not in the pinned description: advisories use `security_events`.
